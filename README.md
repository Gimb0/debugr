# debugr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gimb0/debugr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gimb0/debugr)

The main aim of this project was to develop a simple debugger in C to learn how debuggers and other processes work. During the development of this project I also use tools I have never used before to improve the development cycle. Specifically I used:
* CMake
* Travis CI
* GitHub
* Docker
